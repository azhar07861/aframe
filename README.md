A-frame Energy Monitoring Service Bangor University 
This was a dissertation project and the purpose of this was to produce an AR application which will allow users to monitor data in different locations in the real environments. 
This is a location based service which only used A-frame and JavaScript libraries to visualise data in the real environment. 
It did not use any other libraries but used a A-frame component such as, Angle. 
It did not have much libraries which were compitable with AR as A-frame is mostly used for VR.
